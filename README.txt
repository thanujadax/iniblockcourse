The main assignment file is: tutorial_script2.m
The solution to the tutorial is given in: solution_tutorial_script2.m

The general task was to implement the perceptron learning algorithm.
The basic version is given in perceptron.m.
This file is called in the solution script mentioned above.

Some sample movies frames are uploaded here as well to visualize the change
of the classifier during the weight update iterations
file name: movieFrames.mat.
movieFrames can be loaded into matlab workspace by using the load command.
Once loaded, you can play the movie by calling:
