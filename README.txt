The solution to the tutorial is given in: solution_tutorial_script2.m

The genral task was to implement the perceptron learning algorithm.
The basic version is given in perceptron.m.
This file is called in the solution script mentioned above.



Some sample movies frames are uploaded here as well: movieFrames.mat.
 movieFrames can be loaded into matlab workspace by using the load command.
